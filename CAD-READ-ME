The gear ratios and motors used in "2nd Attempt" are most likely wrong as I didn't want to do the calculations.

There are also no spacers or brackets in the cad, nor any of those... weird wheels that push things in towards the center since I suck at
working with hex shafts and didn't want to deal with it.

An additional file not included in the "2nd Attempt" folder, but was used was the intake_arm_front_right because my computer doesn't seem
to want to open file manager right now.

Also, yes, I know it's scuffed, I'm still not very good at using this program.
